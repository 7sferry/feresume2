  impacts: [
    {
      title: "Refactoring Legacy Code to Clean Structure",
      text: `Faced with a legacy codebase that was challenging to develop and maintain, I took the
              initiative
              to refactor it into a clean, modular structure. By implementing centralized exception
              handling,
              request validation, programming to interfaces, and dependency injection, I transformed the
              code
              into a more maintainable and readable state. This resulted in enhanced development
              efficiency
              and improved code quality across the system.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Resolving Concurrency Issues",
      text: `Encountered data anomalies due to concurrency problems like Lost Updates and Write Skew. To
              address this, I introduced optimized solutions such as strategic locking mechanisms and
              improved
              transaction isolation levels. These efforts successfully eliminated the anomalies, ensuring
              data
              consistency and reliability throughout the system.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Customizable Client Behaviors with Design Patterns",
      text: `Faced with the challenge of diverse client behavior requirements, I implemented design
              patterns
              such as Strategy, Command, and Factory Method. This solution provided each client with the
              flexibility to choose and utilize their desired behavior seamlessly.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Optimizing Pagination for Faster Load Times",
      text: `To address slow load times with numeric pagination, I revamped the filtering strategy to
              focus on
              date-based filters and implemented a "load more" pagination approach. This significantly
              reduced
              page load times and improved the overall user experience.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Enhancing Transaction Management with Custom Annotation",
      text: `Legacy code lacked Spring Data JPA, making atomic transactions more complex than using the
              simple
              @Transactional annotation. I developed a custom transactional annotation using AOP, enabling
              centralized management of atomicity using ThreadLocal, isolation, and retryable transactions in the event of
              failures, replicating the behavior of Spring‚Äôs built-in transaction management.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Simplifying Unit Testing with Dependency Injection",
      text: `Some parts of the code were difficult to test due to hidden dependencies. I refactored the
              code
              to use dependency injection, making it easier to mock dependencies in unit tests and
              improving
              testability and maintainability.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Automating Query Logging for QA with AOP",
      text: `To streamline the testing process for the QA team, I developed an AOP-based solution that
              intercepts query generation outside of business logic and sends the query logs directly to
              their
              email. This approach enables QA to access the generated queries independently, without
              needing
              developer intervention.`,
